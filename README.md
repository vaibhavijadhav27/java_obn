Blog Page for The One Byte Show, named The One Byte News

A Mini-Project taken up by our group of Second Year B.E students for creating an application/web-page in Java with SQL as backend.

The One Byte News is a Blog Page for our Podcast The One Byte Show which is hosted on Spotify and Google Podcasts. We wanted a platform to share our tech in the written format.

Frontend - Java (AWT and Swing packages)

Backend - MySQL

Requirements : Java JDK, IDE (any IDE for Java, we used Eclipse), XAMPP (or anything which can host a local SQL server for you), Java ODBC libraries for database connection.

Working:

1. Download the Files, start up SQL on XAMPP and import the .sql file for the database.

2. Now, considering the fact that our blog page was just a brief idea of sharing tech content, we did not implement the idea of comments and likes, thus making the part
of registration pointless. Hence, we do not have Registration as a part of the UI, so you'll have to add your name, email and password entries in the database, you can
do that by using SQL commands or directly through the UI given there, it's rather simple.

3. Once you have you registration set-up, compile and run Login_View.java and login with your credentials. Now you are in the Home Page. Even as a Guest, you have the option
of reading all articles, except you cannot make any changes to them. To write and manage your articles you need to register. 

4. Once you are in, now you can create your articles and edit or delete them.

Since this is a basic idea, we prioritized on implemnting a fully functional website and did not focus much on bells and
whistles, hence you won't see any cool animations in the UI or a text editor.
